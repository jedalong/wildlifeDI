Description: Dynamic interaction refers to spatial-temporal associations in the movements of two (or more) animals. This package provides tools for calculating a suite of indices used for quantifying dynamic interaction with wildlife telemetry data. For more information on each of the methods employed see the references within. The package (as of version >= 0.3) also has new tools for automating contact analysis in large tracking datasets. The package (as of version 1.0) uses the 'move2' class of objects for working with tracking dataset.
